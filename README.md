# DSA-with-Python

This repository is a collection of solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms problems from the Leetcode platform, that I solve on a daily basis.

I am primarily using Python language to solve the DSA questions. But with my interest in being language agnostic, I also write a step-by-step procedure.

My leetcode profile is nukalajayadeep999 (https://leetcode.com/u/nukalajayadeep999/).

Please contact me at nukalajayadeep999@gmail.com if you wish to participate in pair programming with me and learn together.

I am pursuing a master's in Information Technology and Management at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently looking for Software developer opportunities. 

I have created this repository using a Chrome extension [LeetHub v3](https://github.com/raphaelheinz/LeetHub-3.0)
